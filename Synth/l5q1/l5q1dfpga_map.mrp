Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   9 block(s) removed
  12 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "uut3/s<2>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "uut3/s<1>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "uut3/s<0>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "uut3/c_out" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "uut3/blk00000001/sig00000011" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "uut3/blk00000001/sig00000012" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "uut3/blk00000001/sig0000000e" is sourceless and has been removed.
 Sourceless block "uut3/blk00000001/blk00000006" (ROM) removed.
The signal "uut3/blk00000001/sig0000000f" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "uut3/blk00000001/sig0000000d" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "uut3/blk00000001/sig00000013" is sourceless and has been removed.

The trimmed logic reported below is either:
   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

The signal "N1" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "XST_GND" (ZERO) removed.
The signal "clk" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "clk_INV_0" (BUF) removed.
Unused block "uut3/blk00000001/blk00000002" (ONE) removed.
Unused block "uut3/blk00000001/blk00000003" (ZERO) removed.
Unused block "uut3/blk00000001/blk00000004" (FF) removed.
Unused block "uut3/blk00000001/blk00000005" (ROM) removed.
Unused block "uut3/blk00000001/blk00000007" (BUF) removed.
Unused block "uut3/blk00000001/blk00000008/DSP48E1" (DSP48E1) removed.

Guide not run on this design.

Section 9 - Area Group and Partition Summary

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
